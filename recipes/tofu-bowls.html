            <ul>
                <li>14 oz. extra firm tofu</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp cornstarch</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
                <li>1 avocado</li>
                <li>1 bell pepper</li>
                <li>2-3 green onions</li>
                <li>1 handful fresh cilantro</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sweet chili sauce</li>
                <li>2 tsp sesame seeds (optional)</li>
                <li>4 cups cooked rice</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove the tofu from the liquid in the package, wrap it in a clean, lint-free dishcloth or a few paper towels, and press it between two plates with a weight on top for 30 minutes. Once the excess moisture has been pressed out, cut the tofu into 3/4 to 1-inch cubes.</li>
                <li>Season the tofu cubes with a pinch of salt. Sprinkle a tablespoon of cornstarch over top and then toss to coat. Repeat with the second tablespoon of cornstarch.</li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium flame. Once the skillet and oil are hot, add the tofu cubes and fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides. Place the fried tofu in a large bowl.</li>
                <li>Dice the red bell pepper and thinly slice the green onions. Pull the cilantro leaves from the stems and give them a rough chop. Slice the avocado.</li>
                <li>Add the diced bell pepper to the bowl with the fried tofu. Pour 1/3 to 1/2 cup sweet chili sauce over top, then stir until the bell pepper and tofu are coated in the sauce.</li>
                <li>To build the bowls, start with one cup cooked rice, then add 1/4 of the tofu and bell pepper mixture. Add a few slices of avocado to the side of the bowl, then sprinkle the sliced green onion, chopped cilantro, and sesame seeds over top. Enjoy!</li>
